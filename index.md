I am a research scientist at Google Brain. I lead Machine Learning for Machine Learing Compilers effort (one of Google Brain moonshots in 2020).

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Ras Bodik](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/) and [Kathy Yelick](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/). I was a visiting student at the University of Washington for the last two years of my PhD. My dissertation focuses on synthesis-aided compilation and programming models for emerging architectures, ranging from an ultra-low-power processor to a programmable network card.
During my undergraduate at MIT, I did research with [Saman Amarashinghe](http://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/) on an auto-tuning compiler for heterogeneous systems.
