    <h2 id="floem">Floem</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mangpo/floem">Floem</a> is a language, compiler, and runtime for programming NIC-accelerated applications. Floem enables offload design exploration by providing programming abstractions to assign computation to hardware resources; control mapping of logical queues to physical queues; access fields of a packet and its metadata without manually marshaling a packet; use a NIC to memoize expensive computation; and interface with an external application. The compiler infers which data must be transferred between the CPU and NIC and generates a complete cache implementation, while the runtime transparently optimizes DMA throughput.</p>

<h2 id="greenthumb">GreenThumb</h2>

<p><a href="http://pl.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/greenthumb/">GreenThumb</a> is a framework for building superoptimizers. It is designed to be easily extended to a new target ISA. The framework provides an efficient cooperative search strategy that runs multiple search instances cooperatively. Each search instance employs either a symbolic, stochastic, or enumerative search. We develop an new enumerative search technique, called LENS, that rapidly prunes away invalid candidate programs by applying selective refinement and bidirectional search.</p>

<h2 id="chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</h2>

<p><a href="http://pl.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/chlorophyll/">Chlorophyll</a> is a synthesis-aided compiler for unusual spatial architectures. The primary goal of the project is to provide a new way of building compilers for radical architectures with low-effort while its generated code is still efficient. Currently, Chlorophyll can generate code for GreenArrays chip, our stress case study.
The compiler uses constraint solving to partition a program to fit in many tiny cores, and applies superoptimization to automatically discover assembly-level optimizations.</p>

<h3 id="demos">Demos</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Compiled gesture recognition application running on GreenArrays powered by a potato! (<a href="http://youtu.be/6_JV7BlnBwo">video</a>)</li>
  <li>Lemonade-bleach powered GreenArrays running our synthesized program (<a href="http://youtu.be/zMfdef-nYGY">video</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="patabricks">PataBricks</h2>

<p>Extended <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/petabricks">PetaBricks</a> to automatically generate OpenCL kernels and present heterogeneity choices to the autotuner. Introduced hybrid CPU-work-stealing and GPU-work-pushing runtime system.</p>
