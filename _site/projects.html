    <h2 id="xla-tpu-autotuner">XLA TPU Autotuner</h2>
<p>I built an autotuner for the XLA compiler targeting Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) at Google. The autotuner tunes tensor layouts, operator fusion decisions, tile sizes, and code generation parameters in XLA using various search strategies. We incorporate machine learning techniques such as a learned cost model and various learning-based search strategies to reduce autotuning time. Our learned cost model has high accuracy and outperforms a heavily-optimized analytical performance model. The autotuner has been deployed to automatically tune the most heavily-used production models in Google’s fleet everyday.</p>

<h2 id="floem">Floem</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mangpo/floem">Floem</a> is a language, compiler, and runtime for programming NIC-accelerated applications. Floem enables offload design exploration by providing programming abstractions to assign computation to hardware resources; control mapping of logical queues to physical queues; access fields of a packet and its metadata without manually marshaling a packet; use a NIC to memoize expensive computation; and interface with an external application. The compiler infers which data must be transferred between the CPU and NIC and generates a complete cache implementation, while the runtime transparently optimizes DMA throughput.</p>

<h2 id="greenthumb">GreenThumb</h2>

<p><a href="http://pl.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/greenthumb/">GreenThumb</a> is a framework for building superoptimizers. It is designed to be easily extended to a new target ISA. The framework provides an efficient cooperative search strategy that runs multiple search instances cooperatively. Each search instance employs either a symbolic, stochastic, or enumerative search. We develop an new enumerative search technique, called LENS, that rapidly prunes away invalid candidate programs by applying selective refinement and bidirectional search.</p>

<h2 id="chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</h2>

<p><a href="http://pl.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/chlorophyll/">Chlorophyll</a> is a synthesis-aided compiler for unusual spatial architectures. The primary goal of the project is to provide a new way of building compilers for radical architectures with low-effort while its generated code is still efficient. Currently, Chlorophyll can generate code for GreenArrays chip, our stress case study.
The compiler uses constraint solving to partition a program to fit in many tiny cores, and applies superoptimization to automatically discover assembly-level optimizations.</p>

<h3 id="demos">Demos</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Compiled gesture recognition application running on GreenArrays powered by a potato! (<a href="http://youtu.be/6_JV7BlnBwo">video</a>)</li>
  <li>Lemonade-bleach powered GreenArrays running our synthesized program (<a href="http://youtu.be/zMfdef-nYGY">video</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="patabricks">PataBricks</h2>

<p>Extended <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/petabricks">PetaBricks</a> to automatically generate OpenCL kernels and present heterogeneity choices to the autotuner. Introduced hybrid CPU-work-stealing and GPU-work-pushing runtime system.</p>
